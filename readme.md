# Overview
This files are adapted ones for the older libraries using python 2 for the RFID terminal
RC522 Module. Currently an older checkout branch of the `SPI-Pi` Library is used (before Feb 2019) since newer updates occour in an error
with the MFRC522 class.

In addition there is some UI logic for a terminal, using PyQt5 to read and write the tags on the chip.
It can easily be run on the Pi, touch functionality is build in.
